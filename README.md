# Assignment 5

## Overview

For this assignment you will implement a simple webserver that will support a subset of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
This webserver will service multiple client requests by forking child processes to handle the actual request logic.
In addition, your server will support functionality for program invocation similar to the (older) common gateway interface approach.

## Course Learning Objectives

This assignment addresses the following course learning objectives.

### Direct

- Read and write complex programs in the C programming language.
- Transition to upper-division coursework where programming is a tool used in the exploration of course-specific content.
- Transition from following stepwise, prescribed decompositions to independent problem solving.
- Discuss the architecture of the UNIX operating system from a system-programmerâ€™s perspective and be able to write programs that use operating system services (system calls) directly.
- Distinguish language features from operating system features.
- Gain experience with low-level programming in the UNIX environment.
- Consider basic resource management in the development of programs.

# Indirect

- Use standard UNIX user-level commands and the UNIX software development environment.

## Requirements

### Functional Overview

You should start with your echo server solution from Lab 7.
Instead of echoing the client request, your server will implement a subset of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
HTTP is a plaintext line-based protocol, so you are encouraged to use `getline`.
In short, your server will accept a request (details below) for a file, read that file, and send the file contents back to the client.

#### Requirement Overview

### Requirement 1

Your program, named `httpd`, will take one command-line argument specifying the port on which to listen for connections.
The port is an integer value given to the operating system when setting up the network communications.
A webserver usually listens for connections on port 80.
Since this program may be run on university machines (and at the same time as the solutions written by others in the course), you will need to choose a different port.
You may use any number between 1024 and 65535.
 
### Requirement 2

To handle multiple requests your server will spawn child processes.
Each request is to be handled by a single child process.
Once the child process is spawned, your server will need to clean up any unneeded file descriptors and it will eventually need to wait for child processes (this should be done via a signal handler).

### Requirement 3

HTTP is a plaintext line-based protocol.
This assignment requires that you support only two of the HTTP request types: `HEAD` and `GET`.

#### Request

Each request to your server from a client will be one text line of the form:

```
TYPE filename HTTP/version
```

For example,

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

The server will attempt to locate the requested file and, if found, will send a reply with information pertaining to the file and, if a `GET` request, the contents of the file.
A `HEAD` request will only send information about the file (the contents are not sent).
For this assignment, though certainly not in a robust webserver, you can ignore the `HTTP` version information on a request.

Though your server will handle only a single request per child process, it should not close the socket until the client does.

> [!Note]
>
> When connecting to your server in a browser (see below), the web browser will send an http text request as described above to your server.
> For example, using FireFox, my server (hosted on port `1234`) recieved the following requests when connecting to the url `https://localhost:1234/index.html`.
>
> ```
> GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
> ```
>
> ```
> GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1
> ```
>
> A web browser will likely send multiple requests until it recieves a response.
> As such, you will likely see a large number of requests while debugging.
>
> You can also connect to your server using `curl`. The following command: (using the same server described above)
>
> ```
> curl localhost:1234/index.html
> ```
>
> Sends the following request to the server
>
> ```
> GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
> ```

#### Reply

Each reply from your server to a client begins with a header.
The header contains information identifying the type of response, the type of any attached content, and the length of that content.
HTTP supports additional fields in the header, but we are only interested in a subset of HTTP 1.0.
The header ends with a blank line.
Each line of the header must end with `\r\n`.

The following is an example of a reply to a valid request (with the carriage-return, line-feed explicitly shown):

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
Content-Type: text/html\r\n
Content-Length: 5686\r\n
\r\n
<---- contents here ---->
```

The contents come directly from the file without any interpretation.
For this assignment, your program may always specify `text/html` as the content type, regardless of file.

The response to a `HEAD` request provides the header only (no contents).

The content-length can be found using the `stat` system call.

> When connecting to your server in a browser, your server will send the text content above to the browser.
> It may be helpful to create a simple webpage as a file for testing, e.g., an `index.html` that contains:
>
> ```html
> <!DOCTYPE html>
> <html>
> <body>
> <p>Hello, world!</p>
> </body>
> </html> 
>  ```
>
> If using `curl`, the content of the file your server sends (excluding the header) will be printed to `stdout`.

### Requirement 4

Erroneous requests will be responded to with an appropriate error response.
Such a response should have an error type (see below), a content type of text/html, and an appropriate snippet of HTML to be presented to the user (this is often just the response type).
The following are some standard responses that you may find useful:

- `HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request`
- `HTTP/1.0 403 Permission Denied`
- `HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found`
- `HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Error`
- `HTTP/1.0 501 Not Implemented`

You are free to customize the HTML message (which becomes the contents of the response).

### Requirement 5

#### cgi-like Support

In addition to the core behavior of providing files, your server will also provide support for executing a program on the server and sending the output of that program back to the user (this brings with it serious security implications in a real server, so don't leave your server running for very long and implement the `..` check (see details) early.).

Only the programs in the **cgi-like** directory (a subdirectory of the server's working directory) may be executed.
These programs may be passed arguments as part of the request.
These arguments are provided, in the URL, after a `?` following the program name and the arguments are separated by `&` characters.
The arguments themselves are simply strings.
If there are no arguments, then there will be no `?`.

As such, the request header for an attempt to run (as an example) the `ls` program might look as follows (to list the two files mentioned in long format):

```
GET /cgi-like/ls?-l&index.html&main.html HTTP/1.1
```

The `cgi-like` directory name must immediately follow the `/` in order to be considered valid.

Your program will need to `fork` a process to execute this command.
If the `fork` fails, then reply with a 500 error.

If the `exec` of the program is successful, then your valid reply will need to include the size of the contents.
This size, however, cannot be determined until the command completes.
As such, you should have the command redirect to a file (use the child process's pid in the filename to avoid conflicts), read and reply with the contents of the file once the child has terminated, and remove the file after the reply is complete.

### Requirement 6

As with all programs, you must be careful to properly manage any resources used.
Since a webserver is supposed to run forever (or close to), you will need to be especially careful about your resource usage.
Be sure to free memory and close unused file descriptors.
You can use the top program to monitor memory usage while your program executes.

## Additional Details

- The client may close the connection while the server is processing the file.
  Be sure to handle this case without the server crashing.
- We will require the user to always specify a filename.
  No special action will be taken if no file name is provided (i.e., the request has `/`; many servers will attempt to open a default file such as `index.html`).
- We will not support the notion of users, so a URL with a `~` will not attempt to search a home directory.
- All file searches will be done from the directory in which the server is executed.
  Your server should prevent any attempt to access files in directories above its working directory (e.g., using `..`).
  If such a request is received, reply with an error.
  Note that some browsers will automatically remove any `..` in a filename.

## Testing

You can use a web browser to test your program.
If run on the department machines (and you are running your browser from a machine on the campus network, i.e., behind the firewall), then you can use `http://machine_name:port_selected/file`.

An alternative is to use `curl` or the simple client from the previous lab exercise or `telnet` which you might install on your own machine.
When you execute `telnet`, you can provide the machine name (or IP address) and a port.
`telnet` will then provide a prompt at which you can input data to be sent to the server.
Here, you simply write out your request, e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`, and **press Enter twice**.
